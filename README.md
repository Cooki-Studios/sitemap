## Private GitHub repositories
For getting info for private GitHub repositories, you need a Personal Access Token. You can generate one at: [https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new "Generate a Personal Access Token")
<br>
<br>
Give the token a name and expiry. Then give it repository access to whatever repos you want the API to search for.<br>
<br>
Scroll down to the repository permissions and give it read-only access to Contents.<br>
<br>
Click generate token and copy the token to your clipboard.<br>
<br>
Then after cloning the repo, create a file in the main directory called "api_key.txt" and paste your token inside.<br>
Don't add speech marks or quotation marks or any other extra characters. Just paste the key by itself.
